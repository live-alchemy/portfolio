I don't know what this is  
But it feels like coming home  
To a love that I have only dreamed of  

So strong that I pull back  
Like what the hell is that?  
In return a simple statement of fact  

That you're nothing I could ever own  
And I'm proud just to have known you  
At long last the die is cast  

I wanna give you all of me  
It's such a joy to be seen  
Oh we will grow, indeed and I, trust the journey  

Never leave it  
Never leave that space  
Never leave it  
Don't you ever leave your heart  
Just hold it right there  
Centered and in Grace  
I'll be right there  
Meet you in that place
