Shores suffer spores, a reclamation of the senses  
Out of body, out of focus, pronounced dead on arrival  
And this thousand year old tree whose seen the world drift by  
Lifts its head, sleepy eyes, looking out for our survival  

Oh it's so trivial I'm bursting with voyeuristic disbelief  
Hold the phone, hold me  

There are 50 billion people but I know just one of them  
Watch the movies sip on Kool-aid signing we have arrived!  
If I stopped, and listened I would hear your thought for hours  
Big spoons, a bigger cake, someone made sure we'd survive

Oh it's so trivial I'm bursting with voyeuristic disbelief  
Hold the phone, hold me  
I've got to be somewhere at some time, hold me  
I've got to be some where at all times, won't you hold me  

Oh it's so trivial I'm bursting with voyeuristic disbelief  
Hold the phone
