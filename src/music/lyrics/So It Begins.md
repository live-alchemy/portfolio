[C9 Am G Fmaj7]  

Wonder, such a subtle knowing  
Beneath the skin is glowing  
Easy as can be

Neither the witch hunts nor the pulpit  
Could ever make my hear quit  
It's too resilient to break  

For all those we've hurt going too fast  
Lingered in what won't last  
This is forever  

Silence, it is what I love most  
What I see with eyes closed  
No words can describe  

So Love me, love me as your self, please  
Only what comes with ease  
There is joy in crying  
There's such hope in dying  

Love me as your self, dear  
Only what comes without fear  
There is joy in crying  
There is hope in dying
