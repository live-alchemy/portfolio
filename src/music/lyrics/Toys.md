Little boys, playing with toys called diseases  
They make their noise and then they all fall to pieces  
And I get annoyed with the entire species  
I seek the void and read therein a sequence  

So they'll never really know shit about me  
Where I go when I'm walking down the street  

Little girls, well they've all got those same diseases  
But don't get me wrong, they've all been loving me to pieces  
Don't I get along with this half of the species  
Feel the void through each and every touch in perfect sequence  

But they'll never really know shit about me  
Where I go when I'm walking down the street  
Who I know what I sow and what I dream  
The decisions that linger haunting me  

Wouldn't you just love the chance to own me  
Wouldn't you just love to linger on my sleeve  
No no no no no no no no please  

This connection needs just a little more time  
Give it three more years it'll all be fine
