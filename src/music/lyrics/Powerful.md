Oh yeah, we tread lightly  
And we always always always keep to the shadows  
The things we hide behind our jokes  
Oh yeah yeah, oh we tread lightly  
And we only only only come out at nightfall  
The things we hide behind our jokes  

It had to be you  
You were too powerful for me  
You showed me everything I didn't wanna see  
Now I'm eclipsed amidst your fields of green  
You were too powerful for me
