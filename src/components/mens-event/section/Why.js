              <p>
                Combining a decade of experience with breathwork, martial
                practice and Qi Gong, Alex works with these disciplines to
                activate yang energy. As a former musician and performer, he
                also creates a safe space for men to connect with their
                expressive natures and be seen in a shame free environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having experienced tremendous healing through shadow work,
                circle, counseling, therapy and, of course, men's work, Alex
                will facilitate circles and shadow work for the group informed
                by his own experience in unlocking shame, fear and toxic
                masculine energy (aka nice guy syndrome) to bring about a felt
                transformation and deepening in trustability for each man ready
                to take the plunge.
