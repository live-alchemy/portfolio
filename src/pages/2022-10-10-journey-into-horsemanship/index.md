# Journey into Horsemanship

## The Premise

My journey into horsemanship began quizzically. You see, I was gainfully employed in the Spring of 2022 as a software engineer at a trendy company based in Silicon valley called Rivian. They make electric trucks. To boot, I was living the dream on an off grid land project, completing my 40 hours per week thanks to solar panels and Starlink’s newly available satellite WiFi. One problem: I was pretty miserable. As the weather improved, all my friends were outside doing cool stuff while I was ever called back to my desk to ensure I was essentially appearing busy enough. The sad reality was that I was a fairly surplus cog in a machine, with little expected of me and all the room to grow into a life I didn’t want as a corporate desk peon. I knew I needed to find something more in alignment and that, while I appreciated the opportunity, that 100k/year salary just wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be, especially given the weight of income tax in Canada; I’ll not digress overly on that point.

Reflecting back on my life, I realized that there in fact lay a dream waiting, even, for acknowledgement. Horses had always been my sister’s thing. Me and my brother in law would drive the truck around and play music and shoot stuff, but I would ever remain curious about what was happening in the corral, and curious about these beasts who produced all the poop we had to clean up.

## Forays into horsemanship and horse packing

I decided to undertake this learning journey, hired a private lesson for my first time riding as an adult, then moved up progressively longer trail rides that culminated in 4 hours of mountainous trail riding in Pemberton. Behold a n00b:

I had heard of folks going up to work in the Yukon and such places as hunting guides on horseback, so I inquired and was pointed to Stan Walchuk’s school for horse packing in McBride, in the Rocky Mountain trench. I signed up eagerly, finding the price quite reasonable and the timing of mid June just right. I gave my two weeks notice in May and also signed up for a vision quest that would take place at the start of July, but that story is still curing so stay tuned.

As it turns out, Stan had just sold his business but had agreed to stay on and teach that year. Unfortunately, the new owners were wanting for insurance and opted to cancel the course last minute. Only problem: I had arrived on site a week early and was determined. A couple from Ontario had been driving for a few days and missed the memo, so there we were along with Stan’s two Swiss workaways. Stan, being the classy gentleman that he is, offered to teach us the course privately and rent us the horses so we could get a taste for horse packing, what a stand up human!

I really enjoyed the course and got a lot out of it. I also had a great time with Alyssa and Dan. Here are some photos from our time together:

With that period of learning complete, I was ready to head into the vision quest. 10 days later, I tumbled down the Sea to Sky highway landing in Squamish. Admittedly, the world seemed a strange place. After 4 days without food or water, the delights and trinkets of civilization were at once repulsive and irresistible. While I still enjoyed climbing, I was dogged by a feeling of having gone backwards in time, so I began to write to outfitters to see if anyone would have me. As it turns out, some seemed interested. My first bite lead me to the realization that I was ready to hop on a plane to Whitehorse at a moment’s notice, and when the second opportunity started knocking in earnest, I decided to just go for it. I stopped in at the Squamish men’s circle, was duly blessed by my brothers there and started the trip North that night, spying a wolf on the side of the highway on the way out, I regarded this as a stellar omen portending favourably on my time in the wilds of Northern BC.

## Now, a wrangler

I had signed on with Spatsizi River Outfitters, formerly the Collingwood Brothers outfit, lately purchased by a rancher from Quesnel, with the understanding that I would be able to complete a trip to Montreal to see my Father on his 75th birthday in mid August, and that I could spend most of July attending the horsemanship workshops being held at base camp by a famous horse trainer named Glen Stewart. I arrived at Reg Collingwood’s ranch in Smithers on time, was regarded with uncertainty and was tasked with oiling saddles until my ride showed up. Eventually, that is to say at around 8pm, I was collected and then immediately tasked with driving a huge truck pulling a horse trailer. At 2am, my companion Jamie and I pulled into a rest area to get some sleep. I crawled into the back seat where I lay down and eventually caught a few hours rest. In the driver seat, I don’t believe Jamie was as fortunate. At daybreak we forged on to the town of Iskut, some 3 hours up the Cassiar highway and reported to the staging area known as Mountain Shadow, an RV park also owned by the outfit. We offloaded the horses at a large corral and were prepared Kraft dinner for lunch. I made myself some eggs instead, as I have dining standards that I had not yet realized I would fail to maintain. Jamie, who is 18 and now the most experienced person on staff on account of having done this the season prior, and myself finally got rolling to cut the trail to the hunting unit’s first base camp at around 5pm. Known as Bug lake internally and as “Eaglenest Camp” in the marketing materials, we were told it was a two day ride on easy trail.

## Cutting the Trail

The ride got off to a rocky start. Our packhorse rolled his pack as soon as we were out the gate, and the fellow who drove us came trotting up behind brandishing my axe as it had fallen off my horse almost instantly. We repacked the horse, I secured the axe and we departed in earnest only to have the chainsaw fail to start at the second tree we found laying across the trail. Having dealt with a number of chainsaw failures that Winter, I felt that at least this was predictable and Jamie and I were able to diagnose a flooded carb and allowed it to empty out. We eventually got the saw running again and were off, but no sooner had we completed perhaps 15% of the trail did the saw get caught under some trees and was utterly ruined, the bar bent to a full 90 degrees away from the handle. Oh well, good thing I had the axe.

We arrived at the first campsite around 2am, and I was beginning to appreciate the emergence of a theme. The following morning, we noticed that Jamie no longer had his InReach device, but my intuition suggest a quick trot back down the trail and I found it after about 10 minutes at a light jog! We rode on, the pack horse rolling once more and gear tumbling off our saddles again. When we finally got sorted out and settled on a pattern for tying the diamond (a hitch that is essential for keeping a packhorse secured), we made decent time, even without the help of the gasoline powered chainsaw. This is where the trail gets rough. Numerous hours of bogland lay before us and so we trudged on and on until we finally made the second camp. With some hours of daylight left, we opted to ride on and press for Bug, arriving under the auspices of twilight. Exhausted, we noted that a grizzly bear had utterly destroyed the cook house but we opted to leave that as it lay till the morrow.

On the morrow, a float plane landed on the dock and insisted on returning Jamie to Mountain Shadow to lead a group of staff and clients, including Glen Stewart, back down the trail, this time in a single day. The plane also deposited the camp cook, Gwen, whose task it would be to clean the cookhouse. I assisted by fixing the water line and doing what little I could given my exhausted and sore condition, hardly daring to imagine what Jamie was going through. Gwen was able to get Shepherd’s Pie ready and had it warm for the groups arrival at, you guessed it, 2 in the morning. Needless to say, they were a little shell shocked by what had just happened and I was to hear over the next few days, how chaotic it had been to ride in with 43 horses, including 7 colts who all got loose and failed to make it to base camp.

## Chasing the Colts

While we resisted for a few days and attempted to learn what we could from Glen, we were ultimately defeated in our attempts to stay the owners hand and were duly dispatched to track down the missing horses. This time, we had the benefit of riding with Leon, an experienced horseman. Back down the trail we went, or back into the bog we went as the case may be. Arriving at the first camp site after 10 hours of riding, we reported, via InReach, that we had seen fresh sign of the horses but avowed to each other that we were going no further. The owner, whose name is Mike, or Big Taco (it’s a long story), insisted we were hot on their trail and that we were to continue riding down the trail. We grumbled but ultimately rode on the next day. Miraculously, we found two horses in the forest and they duly fell in behind us all the way to “The Grade”, an abandoned rail grade started by the NDP many years ago that serves as the trailhead for the McEwan trail leading into the Spatsizi Wilderness. There we met Taco, who ordered us to continue searching for the rest of the horses while he drove around in his truck. He was beginning to make an impression on me. We found no more horses there, and eventually were permitted to rest and eat. Jamie and I spent the night while Mike took Leon to mountain shadow. They returned the next day and the 3 of us began the journey back with the two colts in tow. Lo and behold, we ride into a small clearing wherein are the remaining 5 colts! We approach cautiously and manage to get the halter of another colt and add them to our string. We rode on expecting the others to follow, but soon enough it became clear they did not. At the first camp, we corralled the horses while Jamie and Leon rode back to see what they could while I made fire and pitched our tent. They returned an hour or two later without any colts and so we settled in to a night of Stag Chili and fart jokes, another trail staple.

We rode all the next day and felt we had at least accomplished something, when their seemed truly no hope. We were told within a day or two that the remaining colts had gone to The Grade and been picked up by Mike, and brought back to Quesnel to his ranch. We spent a few days with Glen and his group and soon enough August rolled around and with it, the promise of the infamous stone sheep hunts.
