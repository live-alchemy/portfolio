This was a web development project in collaboration with Marianne aka Dove & Crow designs for the Lilloet Agriculture and Food Society. The project description was to take a table of farmer resources (which were primarily links to external sites) and create a searchable and indexed database for farmers to consult, giving them easy access to a host of information on just about every imaginable topic that relates to farming in Canada.

This project was pretty unique and actually a ton of fun for me. Working with Marianne is really enjoyable as she is uber organized and also clinical when it comes to design and communicating how she wants things to look. This is ideal for me as I'm not much of a designer but if you tell me the font, the font-size, the proportions, layout etc I can code it!

The other interesting thing about this project was that it began as Wordpress development. We started off by looking at some plugin options. We purchased one, didn't love it (kind of clunky to make work out of the box) and so I ended up playing with this idea of hand coding a React app that I would then embed into the Wordpress page. This ended up being a little tricky but totally workable (one article in particular got me off the ground, thank you dev community)! The React bundle is uploaded to the Wordpress file system and invoked on this page. The data is pulled in from the same file system so that the entries can be edited by anyone who can work with JSON (or XL) format documents who has access to the website files. Looks pretty good right?! Oh and it's super fast thanks to React.js ;)
