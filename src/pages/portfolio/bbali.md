#### Breathwork Bali landing page

I met Edward in Whistler one fine morning at Ed's Bred in Creekside. We both ordered ChaÃ¯ and sat next to one another. After making initial eye contact, I realized I recognized this face from the gram. You see, Edward runs Biology of Breath, or at least he did up until he recently decided to move his small family over to Bali to continue expanding his practice of Breath Work in an environment decidedly less dreary than BC in the Winter! Can't fault him there.

Leaving behind a crew of folks ready to hold space for the breath workers of the Sea to sky, Edward asked me to build him a new site to advertize his clinic hours and retreats over in Bali. We both like the look and feel of his original project [BiologyOfBreath.com](https://biologoyofbreath.com) and had essentially the same logo as a starting point. From there, I opted to start from scratch with a custom build (surprise surprise) that deploys to Zeit.co with one command for fast updates. I used UIKit for the styling and grid and the WordPress API to pull in existing blog content for the blog page. The contact form makes use of Formspree.io. All told, this website does not cost anything on the month to month, which I find super cool. The only drawback is that Formspress redirects to their page when someone submits the form, so down the road, I may build a more robust solution with a little mail server living some place. Yet another microservice project in the making ðŸ˜„ !
