#### Taski - Work wherever, whenever

###### [View Website](https://www.taskiapp.com)

My first job after completing the programming boot camp Decode Montreal was and still is with Taski Mobile Inc!
A platform economy app for the hospitality industry, Taski pairs qualified serving staff with hotels, caterers and event planners to meet their on demand staffing needs. Primarily based in Vancouver, Taski has a thriving user base of hundreds of taskers filling hundreds of shifts each and every week.

How I came to join Taski is a serendipitous story. I was living in Squamish, had just moved there and was hoping to use the proximity to Vancouver to find work as a developer. So I signed up to volunteer at a conference on Dev Ops (I didn't really know what that was but suffice to say it was techy af). I worked the conference and attended talks and enjoyed it but not too much came of it until after day two when I got a text from a new number asking if I had some time to take a look at their web-app, they saw I had some React skills on this new platform I had joined looking for work (hint, the platform was Taski!). I met up with Rishabh that very evening at the Hootsuite headquarters where he had just moved through their "Next Big Thing" program and got to hacking. Yup, the app was busted, not sure why yet, can I take it home and keep working?

I took the software home and began combing through the software. At this point, I'd never debugged anything, never even really run a Node app cloned from some other project and didn't really know what I was doing, but I figured it out and eventually found the offending bracket, corrected the query that was causing no shifts to be found for the feed and got the whole thing re-deployed (not without one harrowing evening on the phone with Rishabh that ended with us running the app off his computer piping his local copy to the server... which was insane but it was 11pm and we were wrecked lol).

Needless to say, I have learned a lot along the way, to the degree that I'd actually call myself a mid level developer now. I certainly still have blind spots, and I've never even worked in a team! But hey, I can sure as funk figure it out.
