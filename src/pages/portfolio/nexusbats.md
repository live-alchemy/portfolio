### Solana Candy Machine project built with NextJS

My dear old friend Robbie hit me up one day and asked if I wanted to join a Solana project that was a candy machine for anthropomorphic bat art and I said ok sure. The fun part was that we got to work together and I was able to lead the technical direction of the project. We also got to work with some new concepts like how to mint NFTs and use some really cool art on this one. While the price of Solana took a dive around launch time and this never actually went live, I'm proud of the product we delivered, complete with documentation and good code review practices as well as a lightning fast deployment strategy. All in all, we are probably the only people on the project to get paid, as the others mostly accepted a share of the profits from the drop, but we negotiated a fixed rate for this contract and were paid in SOL, which we quickly sold amidst the chaos of some exchange or other going belly up! Here are some other animations from the site that were pretty neat:
