### Online ordering as a Progressive Web App for Presta Coffee roasters

An iteration on the concept that came out of our visit Salt & Straw in Venice. This time for a coffee roaster in Tucson Arizona. I was at their Mercado plaza location, sitting in the courtyard with a friend about to do some reading in preparation for a discussion we were attending that night. Naturally, we wanted some cold brew as it was both nice out and a featured item on Presta's seasonal menu. I volunteered to get our drinks (big mistake! apparently) and found myself waiting in line for at least 10 minutes before the lone barista could pour out two cold brews for me.

Now, the dream, wouldn't it be lovely if I could just order on my phone while sitting outside and get up when my drinks are called out or I get a notification that my order is up!? Why yes, it certainly would. So I threw together this app, got in touch with one of the owners and after learning they work with Square, rewrote the payments module to use the Square API for payment processing to integrate seamless with their existing PoS terminal! I never heard back after that, which is kind of typical, it seems, when you're pitching people, but the proof of concept remains a visually appealing treat nonetheless.
