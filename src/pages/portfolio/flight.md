#### Flight of Phantoms - aerial cinematographers

###### [View Website](https://desforets.github.io/flightofphtms/)

These videos were almost all shot on a **Mavic Pro** from DJI. Some of the early ones were done with a **Phantom 4** (hence the name), also made by DJI. Chronicles adventures, primarily in the company of Freya aka [@theconsciousclimber](https://instagram.com/theconsciousclimber)  in aerial cinematography and post production efforts, most of which were done with Linux, which, frankly, I would not recommend! I'm currently in the process of doing a home repair on my drone so this handle has fallen into some disuse but that's ok. I never did get any paid gigs as **Flight of Phantoms**, because I don't market myself (thus, this website!).
